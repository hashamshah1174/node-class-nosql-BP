## How To Contribute?

Writing huge blocks of code is indeed a tedious and time-consuming job. You put all your efforts into getting the job done at the right time but have you ever noticed that once you deliver your work to your teammates, it somehow gets delayed? Why?

1. Your pull request is not linked to any Jira Ticket.
2. Your pull request title is too vague.
3. Your pull request is missing a proper description/summary.
4. Your pull request lacks the steps for performing the task.
5. Your pull request has no images or videos.

These small mishaps can lead to quite a time waste. Don't assume that the other person knows what you've done, always try to avoid such mistakes by following these tips:

1. **Ensure that your new branch and PR are always ahead of the `main` branch.**
2. **Ensure that your PR has a proper title.**

| **Pull Request Title**                      | **Approach** |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| feat/login                                  | ‚ùå           |
| DA-XX : Adds Login Feature To Existing Site | ‚úî            |

3. **Ensure that your PR is minimalistic and task-oriented.**
4. **Ensure that your PR must not exceed more than 10 file changes.**
5. **Ensure that your PR [follows the defined template](/.github/pull_request_template.md), refer to this [example](https://github.com/Fullstop-pk/Dade-Auctions/pull/117).**
6. **Ensure that your PR has appropriate [attached labels](https://github.com/Fullstop-pk/Dade-Auctions/labels).**
7. **Ensure that your commits follow [proper conventions](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) like**

| **Commit**                                  | **Approach** |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| feat: adds sign-in button to the login page | ‚úî            |
| chore: updates .gitignore file              | ‚úî            |
| doc: removes the unused headings            | ‚úî            |
| test: adds forgot password flow             | ‚úî            |
| fix: admin screen related ui issues         | ‚úî            |
| refactor: variable MSA to hasMSA            | ‚úî            |

8. **Ensure that your PR does not remain open for a long time.**
9. **Use `git branch --delete <branchname>` to remove your local stale branch.**
